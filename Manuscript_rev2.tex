  While optical trapping is a well understood method for force
  transduction and detection,characterisation of trapped entities
  poses a two-fold challenge --- one experimental concerning the
  arrangement of light detectors and the other, theoretical involving
  solving of the inverse light scattering problem. Combining static
  light scattering techniques with optical trapping poses significant
  engineering challenges due to the space constraints in a
  conventional optical trapping setup.  We propose here a plausible
  scenario of detecting scattered light from an optically trapped
  asymmetric microstructure using a novel, multi-angle, optical-fibre
  based detection scheme and demonstrate how a Bayesian inference
  based analysis of the data simulated to mimic light scattering
  detection signals in such scenarios maybe used for solving the
  inverse light scattering problem and help characterise trapped
  entities.  To this end, we discuss the application of our method to
  infer the instantaneous orientations of an asymmetric microsphere
  dimer being trapped. We argue that this method can be extended for
  determining any characteristics of the trapped microstructure that
  influence the light scattering pattern.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

Since their invention in the late 1980's, Optical Tweezers have found application in experiments ranging from single molecule biophysics \cite{Bustamante2021Biophysics} to those that test the fundamental assumptions of Quantum Mechanics  \cite{yin2013large} thanks mainly to the ability of the tweezer to transduce and detect forces on the order of a few pico newtons. \textit{Further characterisation of the trapped entity would provide useful information, as explored in for example} metrological measurements \cite{arita2020coherent} and colloidal aggregation \cite{burns1990optical}. Chemical characterisation of the trapped entities has been achieved using spectroscopic techniques such as Raman Scattering \cite{gupta2014raman}, while dynamical characterisation has been demonstrated using a Quadrant Photo Detector,  by following the centre-of-mass Brownian motion of the trapped entity  \cite{friedrich2012tuning} and measuring rotation  of the centre-of-mass \cite{yifat2021facile}. 

The possibility of integrating light scattering with optical trapping was demonstrated by Saffran and co-workers in \cite{Bar-Ziv_1998} where a single-mode optical fibre was aligned to detect the scattered
light from a trapped bead and its Brownian motion was studied.  While this allowed for studying the dynamics, structural information about the trapped bead was precluded as the measurement was obtained only at a single angle.  In this work, we propose a scheme that expands on the technique in \cite{Bar-Ziv_1998} to detect scattered light simultaneously at 3 angles as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}, combined with a novel Bayesian Inference based analysis technique to enable interpretation of the resulting multi-angle data as well as optimisation of the setup to provide maximal information from the signal.

To demonstrate the analysis, we study a simple, illustrative example of a trapped entity more complex than a single sphere (i.e.\ a trapped asymmetric dimer).  We explore how to optimise the experimental measurement to obtain the best estimate of the dimer's instantaneous orientation, as a further paradigmatic example of interpretation of the scattering data to obtain dynamical information on the trapped entity. There is a paucity of literature on measuring the orientation of trapped non-spherical particles till the recent attempt in Ref.~\cite{raudsepp2022estimating} where imaging was employed to study the orientation of trapped dimers.  Here, we simulate the Brownian motion of a dimer and calculate the resulting scattered light, and show how Bayesian inference can be used to optimise extraction of the true dimer orientation from the light scattering signals given a choice of scattering measurement angles.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:Method}

\subsection{Brownian Simulation}
\label{sec:brownian}

We use the Brownian OT package developed by Fung~\textit{et~al}. \cite{Vigilante2020Brownian_OT} to simulate the motion of a asymmetric dimer within an optical trap. Brownian OT combines MSTM \cite{Mishchenko1996MSTM} and ``Optical Tweezer Toolbox'' (\textit{ott}) \cite{Lenton2020} to simulate the motion of arbitrary
shaped sphere clusters. We simulated the motion of a silica dimer
trapped in a highly focused Gaussian beam.   

The dimer's Brownian motion is simulated by calculating its diffusion tensor according to Farsund's \emph{et al} work \cite{Farsund1996}. For computing the optical force Brownian OT uses the T-Matrix method to calculate scattering of the dimer. MSTM computes the T-matrix of the dimer, and then passes the T-matrix to \textit{ott} to compute the optical forces. The benefit of this approach is that MSTM can accurately compute the T-matrix for any arbitrary collection of spheres once, and then \textit{ott} can calculate the optical forces and torques. The total displacement is the sum of the optical and Brownian contributions.

Brownian OT returns the dimer's motion as a \textit{csv} file containing for each time step the $[x,y,z]$ position of the dimer's centre of mass relative to the trap focus, and the orientation represented as a quaternion.

\subsection{Orientation estimation from scattering measurements}
\label{sec:Bayes}

We consider our dimer from Section~\ref{sec:brownian} in an optical trap; at any point in time we can draw a unit vector $\hat{s}$ that points from the centre of larger sphere, to the centre of the smaller sphere. A plane wave 'probe' laser, directly perpendicular to the trapping laser, is incident on the dimer generating a scattering pattern that is dependent upon the dimer's orientation $I(\hat{\bf s}, \theta)$, computed using MSTM. To represent the experimental set up, three angles  ($\theta_1, \ \theta_2, \ \theta_3$) were chosen and the calculated intensity at each angle $\theta_k$ was recorded as $I(\hat{s}, \theta_k)$

Our goal is to determine the orientation of our trapper dimer based on the scattering measurements $I(\hat{n}, \ \theta_k)$ collected from three detection fibres situated at $\theta_1,\ \theta_2, \ \& \ \theta_3$. Rather than get an exact estimate of the dimer's orientation the possible orientation space is discretized into $\textit{n}_{ref} \ = \ 30$ possible reference orientations $\hat{\bf n}_{\alpha}$ that are evenly distributed on a unit sphere \cite{Rey2006}, see Figure~\ref{fig:dimer} b. The maximum spacing between two neighbouring reference orientations is roughly 0.895 radians. 

Using MSTM we compute the raw intensities that would be collected from the dimer in each reference orientation $I(\hat{\bf n}_{\alpha}, \theta_k)$. 
%
These raw intensities are normalized according to
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scale}
  y_k(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
  = 
  \frac{I(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha, \theta_k) - \langle I(\hat{\bf n},\theta_k) \rangle } 
  {\langle I^2(\hat{\bf n},\theta_k) \rangle -\langle I(\hat{\bf n}, \theta_k)\rangle^2}
\end{align}
where the denominator is simply the standard deviation for our values of $I(\hat{\bf n}, \theta_k)$. The reference orientations, raw intensities, and scaled signals are given in Tables~\ref{tab:A1} and \ref{tab:A2}. The distribution of collected signals bares no specific relationship with its associated reference orientation, in some cases different reference orientations will have identical signals. This is an inherent challenge of the inverse light scattering problem, fortunately we can apply statistical techniques to resolve the lack of relationship between orientation and scattering.

In practice, $y_k(\hat{\bf s})$ will have an inherent amount of uncertainty in its measurement. We can compare any instantaneous signal $y_1, y_2, y_3$ to our reference signals by assuming that the measurement uncertainty is Gaussian and is centred about $y_k(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$.
%
Combining the signals from all three detection angles provides us with the conditional probability that, should the dimer be in orientation
$\hat{\bf n}_\alpha$, it would produce a signal ($y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$):
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conditional}
  p(y_1, y_2, y_3|\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
  = \prod^3_{k=1}
(2\pi\sigma_k^2)^{-1/2} 
e^{-(y_{k}-y_{k}(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha))^2/2\sigma_k^2}
\end{align}
where $\sigma_k$ is related to the uncertainty in our measurement $y_k(\hat{\bf s})$. We left this as a tuneable parameter to determine the influence of experimental error on our predictive method. To simulate uncertainty in our measurement we stochastically adjusted our values of $y_k(\hat{\bf s})$. Equation~\eqref{eq:conditional} gives the probability that a signal ($y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$) will be measured if a dimer is in reference orientation $\hat{\rm n}_\alpha$. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the dimer is in reference orientation $\hat{\bf n}_\alpha$, given that the signal ($y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$) is measured, can be estimated:
%.
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:bayes}
  p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha| y_1,y_2,y_3)
  &=
    \frac{p(y_1,y_2,y_3|\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
    p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)}{p(y_1, y_2, y_3)}
\end{align}
where $p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ and $p(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ are the prior estimates of the distributions of particle orientations and instantaneous signals, respectively.
%
Without any prior evidence we assume that the orientation priori of our dimer
$p(\hat{\bf n}_{\alpha})$ is uniform. Knowledge of the dimer from previous
measurement can be used to inform our estimate of $p(\hat{\bf n}_{\alpha})$, covered in Section~\ref{sec:test}.  The latter prior $p(y)$ is the probability of measuring a signal ($y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$).  This is given by taking the discrete integral over collection of reference orientations.
\begin{align}
  p(y_1, y_2, y_3)
  =
  \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_{\rm ref}}
  p(y_1, y_2, y_3|\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
  p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:bayes} we get a mass probability distribution that denotes the
probability that our dimer is in orientation $\hat{\bf n}_{\alpha}$ given a
signal ($y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$). In order to evaluate the accuracy of our method, we tested it using a Brownian dynamics simulation of the dimer (see Section~\ref{sec:brownian}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Calculation of error}
\label{sec:divergence}
Section~\ref{sec:Bayes} covered how Bayes theorem can be applied to estimate
the orientation of a dimer based on its scattering signal. To evaluate the estimation we can use the simulation in Section~\ref{sec:brownian}; we denote the dimer's \emph{actual} orientation as $\hat{\bf s}$ and use MSTM to calculate its light scattering $I(\hat{\bf s}, \theta)$. At each angle $\theta_k$ we use \eqref{eq:scale} to scale the measurements collected from our dimer and record them as $y_1(\hat{\bf s})$, $y_2(\hat{\bf s})$, $y_3(\hat{\bf s})$. These measurements signals are used to calculate $p(\hat{\bf n}_{\alpha}\parallel y_1, y_2, y_3)$, because we know $\hat{s}$ we can determine which reference orientation is closest, denoted as $\hat{\bf n}_{best}$.

To measure the error in the model's estimate the distribution from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:bayes} and an ideal result, $p_ideal$, were compared.  An ideal result would be one that is 0 for every $\hat{\bf n}$ apart from $\hat{\bf n}_{best}$.
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:best}
	p_{best} = 
	\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{when $\hat{\bf n}_\alpha$ = $\hat{\bf n}_{best}$}\\
		0 & \text{anywhere else}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
The distribution from Eq.~\eqref{eq:bayes} will assign some non-zero
probability to every reference orientation. The model's error was measured by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence $K_l$ between the two distributions.
\begin{align}
	K_{l, \#}(p_{best}\parallel p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha| y_1, y_2, y_3))
	= p_{best}\ln \left[\frac{p_{best}}{p(\hat{\bf n}_{best}| y_1,y_2,y_3))}
	\right]
	\label{eq;kullback}
\end{align}
where a larger value of $K_l$ indicates that our model is less confident in its 
prediction of the dimer's orientation. The divergence provides us a measure of how confident our measurement is. To better reflect the model's accuracy we implemented a penalty condition that worsens the divergence if our model estimates the wrong reference orientation:
\begin{align}
	p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha|y_1,y_2,y_3) = 
	\begin{cases}
		p(\hat{\bf n}_{est}|y_1,y_2,y_3) & 
		\text{when $\hat{\bf n}_{estimate}$ = $\hat{\bf n}_{best}$}\\
		p(\hat{\bf n}_{est}|y_1,y_2,y_3)-p(\hat{\bf n}_{best}|y_1,y_2,y_3) & \text{when $\hat{\bf n}_{est} \ne \hat{\bf n}_{best}$}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}

This allows us to account for situations when our collected signal is equally likely to be associated with 2 reference signals. Section~\ref{sec:Bayes} and Section~\ref{sec:divergence} are all for a single measurement of a light scattering signal from our dimer. To properly model it's motion we need to consider how the orientation changes with time. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing the Model}
\label{sec:test}

Using our simulation from Section~\ref{sec:brownian} we simulated the motion of a silica dimer trapped within a 5 mW optical trap. The dimer is comprised of two tangent spheres with radii $1 \mu m$ and $0.5 \mu m$ respectively. We simulated the first 10 seconds of motion, calculating the orientation and position every 1 ms. 

We applied Eq.~\eqref{eq:bayes} --- covered in Section~\ref{sec:Bayes} --- and the reference orientation with the highest probability is taken as our estimation of the dimer's instantaneous orientation. To visualise our model's performance  we plotted the radial distance between our estimation $\hat{\bf n}_{est}$ of the orientation and the dimer's \emph{actual} instantaneous orientation $\hat{\bf s}$ versus time. For comparison, we also plotted the radial distance between the closest reference orientation, denoted $\hat{\bf n}_{best}$, and the dimer's instantaneous orientation. The dotted line indicates the maximum radian distance ($0.896$ radians) between two neighbouring reference orientations, if we are under this line then we know our estimate and the best result are beside one another. If we assume our prior of the reference orientations $p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ to be uniform the performance is poor, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:uniform}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./Images/fig3.png}
	\caption{Model's estimation of dimer orientation while assuming $p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ to be uniform. Blue line denotes the best result we can achieve, orange line denotes the result provided by eq~\ref{eq:bayes}. Dotted line denotes maximum spacing between two neighbouring $\hat{\bf n}_\alpha$, see Sec~\ref{sec:Bayes}.}
	\label{fig:uniform}
\end{figure} 

The reasoning for this lies with the fact that differences in reference signals and reference orientation spacing are not directly correlated with each other. In some cases, two reference orientation will have identical signal responses. To remedy this we need to account for the fact that a trapped dimer's motion i limited due to the trap stiffness. Therefore, the prior of the reference orientations $p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ was defined at each time step by accounting for the physical distance between our previous estimate $\hat{\bf n}_{est}(t - \Delta t)$ and each reference orientation $\hat{\bf n}_\alpha(t)$:

\begin{align}
  p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
  &=\frac{e^{\beta (\hat{\bf n}_\alpha (t) 
  	\cdot \hat{\bf n}_{est}(t-\Delta t))}}
  {\sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_{\rm ref}}
	e^{\beta (\hat{\bf n}_\alpha (t) 
	\cdot \hat{\bf n}_{est}(t-\Delta t)}}
\end{align}

where $\beta$ is a weighting factor that describes the dimer's freedom of motion within the trap. By summing over each reference orientation $p(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ is normalized. The simulation data from Section~\ref{sec:brownian} was used to evaluate our model's performance --- covered in Section~\ref{sec:divergence}. By summing the divergence of each measurement across the entire simulation we get an evaluation of how well the model performed in estimating the dimer's orientation. To compare the effects of changing certain parameters on the performance of our model we compare our result of $K_{l,total}$ to a worst case scenario and evaluate how much it improves upon this, denoted as $F(K_l)$:

\begin{align}
K_{l, \ total} &= \sum\limits_{\# =1}^{timesteps} K_{l,\#} \\
K_{l, \ worst} &= \sum\limits_{\#=1}^{timesteps} \ln \left[\frac{1}{1/n_{ref}} \right] \\
F(K_l) &= \frac{K_{l,\ worst}}{K_{l, \ total}}
\end{align}

The worst case scenario is akin to randomly choosing a reference orientation at each time step. The greater the value of $F(K_l)$ the better our model fits the dimer's motion. Because our model is dependent on several parameters we need to a sophisticated method for understanding how these parameters correlate with $F(K_l)$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Optimization of parameters}
\label{sec:ultranest}

The signal error $\epsilon$ and the weighting factor $\beta$ are known quantities whose influence can be measured directly; however, our choice of angles and how they correlate with $F(K_l)$ is not easily understood Evaluating every possible configuration manually is inefficient, therefore we utilised UltraNest to apply a Monte Carlo simulation to our model. UltraNest is a Python package for fitting models with complex parameter correlations \cite{Buchner2016Ultranest}. UltraNest implements a variation of Monte Carlo integration, nested-sampling, where a likelihood contour is used to update a group of live points chosen from the prior estimation ($0^{\circ} \leq \theta_k \leq 180^{\circ}$).

The UltraNest software was used to create a set of live points of different choices of $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$, with each point being evaluated by its improvement factor ($F(K_l)$). After evaluating every live point, the worst results are removed and new live points are created based on the information provided by the previous live points. If there is a correlation between the choice of angles and $F(K_l)$ then the live points should congregate around a single (or multiple) choice of angles that will maximise $F(K_l)$ and therefore minimise the error between our estimate and instantaneous orientation.

\section{Results and  Discussion}

\subsection{Asymmetric dimer dynamics}
\label{sec:motion}

The Brownian OT software was used to simulate the motion of a trapped dimer ($a_1=1\,{\rm \mu m}$, $a_2=0.5\,{\rm \mu m}$) over the first $10$ seconds of entering the optical trap.  The initial orientation was assumed as strictly vertical (in line with the beam propagation direction). The dimer's position orientation was recorded every 1 ms for using as a test dataset for our model.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

	\caption{Simulation results of: (a) the dimers orientation vector with time, (b) the dimer's [x,y,z] position with time.}
	\label{fig:motion}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:motion}, the dimer undergoes a full $180^{\circ}$ rotation upon entering the trap.  Typically horizontal alignment of a dimer is unstable and will result in the particle rotating to align along its vertical axis.  It is interesting to note that the dimer is furthest from the trap centre as it goes into a horizontal orientation before drawing closer again as it inverts completely. Further simulations of differently sized dimers showed sa similar behaviour of moving away from the trap focus while remaining trapped, but only when $a_1 \geq 2a_2$.  Dimers with size ratios $a_1 < 2a_2$ immediately aligned into a fixed vertical position.
%
In the simulations of Vigilante~\emph{et~al}.\ \cite{Vigilante2020Brownian_OT}, trapped symmetrical dimers were investigated; their findings showed that the optical torque on the dimer goes to zero while aligned vertically and is at its maximum in a horizontal alignment.  Therefore, the inversion of an asymmetric dimer suggests that if the size difference is significant the optical torque goes is minimal for a dimer in both horizontal and vertical orientations. Once we have our experimental set up complete we can confirm this by trapping an asymmetric dimer and monitoring its orientation.  The data from Figure~\ref{fig:motion} was used to test the efficacy of our predictive model.  To visualise how well our model tracks the dimer's orientation we plot the radial distance between our model's prediction and the true orientation, and between the best possible orientation and the true orientation.  For a perfect estimation these two plots should overlap, while we cannot achieve an exact estimation we can optimise it by adjusting the expected signal error and weighting factor.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Impact of measurement precision on model predictions}
\label{sec:epsilon}

A key assumption of Eq.~\eqref{eq:conditional} is that we assume our measurement of scattering signals will inherently have some degree of uncertainty. This is the central premise that allows us to form Eq.~\eqref{eq:conditional}. In an experimental situation the most common source of uncertainty is from the detection bias. Therefore, understanding the limits of acceptable uncertainty is necessary for implementing this to experimental work. To this end we redefined $\sigma_k$ as the average reference signal $\bar{y}(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ multiplied by the percent error caused by the signal detectors:
\begin{align}
	\sigma_k = \epsilon \bar{y}(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)
\end{align} 
We ran our model while varying the value of $\epsilon$, Figure~\ref{fig:epsilon} shows the performance of the method with a selection of angles $15^{\circ}$, $55^{\circ}$, and $90^{\circ}$ and $\beta$ set to $1$:

\begin{figure}[h]
	
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.32\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Images/fig5a.png}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.32\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Images/fig5b.png}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.32\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Images/fig5c.png}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Model prediction for signal error of (a) $5\%$, (b) $15\%$, and (c) $25\%$. Blue line denotes the best result we can achieve, orange line denotes the result provided by eq~\ref{eq:bayes}. Dotted line denotes maximum spacing between two neighbouring $\hat{\bf n}_\alpha$, see Sec~\ref{sec:Bayes}.}
	\label{fig:epsilon}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:epsilon}, there is a sweet spot for the signal error; with a $5$\% error giving an inaccurate estimation, and with a $25$\% error providing a satisfactory estimate but with sudden shifts away from the ideal result. A reason why our low error estimation performed so poorly is that the minimum difference between our values of $y_k(\hat{\bf n}_\alpha)$ is larger than our signal error. As such the model could not distinguish between different reference orientations and was essentially just picking options at random. This minimum difference determined by our choice of angles and sets a lower limit of how accurate our signals can be. Because there is not a unique relationship between the reference orientations and their respective signals this cannot be mitigated by increasing $\textit{n}_{ref}$. 

The latter issue of a high signal error can be addressed somewhat by adjusting our value of $\beta$ to flatten our probability distribution. We repeated our model estimation at $25\%$ with different values of $\beta$ to see the upper limit we could improve our result to.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.33\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Images/fig6a.png}
	\end{subfigure}

Dotted line denotes maximum spacing between two neighbouring $\hat{\bf n}_\alpha$, see Sec~\ref{sec:Bayes}.}
	\label{fig:beta}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beta}, eventually $\beta$ begins to over correct our estimate to the extent that we are a full radian away from the correct result. The exact value of $\beta$ that will optimise our performance varies for each choice of angle, therefore we can use it as variable for finely tuning our results to suit our choice of angles and our signal error. In future, we want to also investigate the possibility of extending our prior $p(\hat{\bf n})$ so we account for not just the change in orientation after one time step but after 2 or 3 time steps to investigate the auto correlation function of our dimer's motion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Parameter Optimisation Results}
\label{sec:ultranest_res}

We wanted to see if our choice of angles plays a significant role in our model's efficacy. We employed UltraNest to analyse the parameter space for our three angles by sampling across the priori of $10^{\circ} \ \& \ 180^{\circ}$.  We kept both $\beta$ and $\sigma_k$ constant during this so we could as these are parameters that can be changed more freely.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:corner} is the resulting corner plot from our UltraNest sampler, darker areas indicate a choice of angles where the model performed better where as lighter areas are where the model did poorer. Overall from the corner plot provided, it is clear that there is no direct correlation between our method's estimation of orientation and the choice of detection angle. This result only indicates that orientation is not a characteristic that is angularly biased in its scattering. It might well be that for other characteristics, such as size or shape, the choice of detection angles may have a more direct impact on our model's performance. 

While the choice of angles does not provide a direct improvement in our estimation it does determine how finely we can estimate the orientation, for choices of angles that are close together the minimum spacing between our signals is so small that we cannot achieve any greater accuracy than dividing the orientation space into $n_{\rm ref}=30$ reference orientations.  We hope to develop our method further in the future by being able to determine the maximum accuracy given that we know the signal error of our measurements. 

As covered in Section~\ref{sec:epsilon} our choice for beta can help to improve our estimation by restricting it in the physical space. In addition depending on our choice of angles we are also setting the lower limit for our measurement precision, so it may be preferable to choose a selection of angles that allows for a larger measurement uncertainty and then adjust the weighting factor to improve upon our estimation.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

We have developed a method for interpreting the dynamics of a trapped particle based purely on the light scattering pattern. In theory the model can be applied to any characteristic that impacts the light scattering pattern produced by the trapped entity. The MSTM package is flexible in calculating the light scattering for a variety of micro-particles; so long as there is a distinguishable difference in the light scattering pattern we can apply this method to characterise the particle to some degree of accuracy. This has potential to be applied to characterise particle size and shape that are changing while in the optical trap. We hope to in the future apply this to our own experimental work by charactering the orientation of a trapped asymmetric particle.\\
