# Latex Files Explanation

The Latex files folder is a way for easily transferring files
between one machine and another while having the flexibility
to switch between different journal styles. The folder can be
subdivided into the following.

## Archive

Simple storage of older verions of the same paper (using
whatever style guide was being used at the time). This is just
so we can keep track of any changes between different versions.

## Manuscipt Scattering

The main folder for storing different manuscripts for the
scattering paper, this contains each journal version of the
main paper, being labelled appropriatly. Consistency between
the actual text is maintained by using merger to check for any
text differences. This is also where any table data, and
figures are stored. Lib folder has any referenced papers in pdf form.

## Manuscript Dimers

### Elesivier, Optica, Spie

Storage folders for the different style guides of each
journal, these can be transferred between papers without much
fuss. They also serve as reference documents to make sure our
paper is conplient with the different journal standards.
